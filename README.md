# Mullpy

A little tool to check if you're currently connected to **Mullvad** VPN or not. Read the _very flattering_ [Mullvad review here](https://thatoneprivacysite.net/2017/10/03/mullvad-review/) by [That One Privacy Site](https://thatoneprivacysite.net/)

The tool _does not_ intend to be a swiss army knife, just a weekend mini project so I don't have to go to [am.i.mullvad.net](http://am.i.mullvad.net/) everytime to check on my connection. **For WebRTC and DNS leaks you should go to their website!**
